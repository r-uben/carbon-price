	abstract = {This paper examines the driving factors of China carbon price in a systemic way with quantitative analysis. Specifically, three categories of driving forces as macro economy risk and uncertainty, energy and environment factors are selected to investigate their impacts on carbon price in China, by adopting the dynamic connectedness measurement approach. The empirical results confirm each driving factor has made contributions to the carbon price fluctuations, and the dynamic interactions among them have enhanced connectedness of the whole system. However, the directional dynamic spillovers indicate main driving factors to carbon price are heterogeneous varying over the whole sample and in different carbon markets. Most importantly, market sentiment plays main role in the carbon price dynamics of Guangdong market, whereas the electric power index makes great effects to Hubei carbon price changes, and the carbon price fluctuations in Shenzhen market are largely caused by air quality situation.}

	abstract = {Despite the reform of the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), discussions about complementing it with a carbon price floor (CPF) are ongoing. This paper analyzes the effect of a European CPF in the reformed EU ETS using a Hotelling model of the EU ETS, amended by the market stability reserve (MSR), and the cancellation mechanism. Two CPF designs are compared: (1) a buyback program and (2) a top-up tax. The buyback program sets a minimum price for the allowances from the implementation year onwards. After the announcement, firms anticipate the CPF, which immediately increases the carbon price to the discounted CPF level. Therefore, firms emit less and bank more allowances, leading to more intake into the MSR, and more cancellation of allowances. The top-up tax imposes a tax on emissions, which enhances the market price of allowances to the CPF level from the implementation year onwards. Firms increase their short-run emissions in anticipation of the upcoming tax. Only after the implementation year firms start to lower their emissions. Thus, the effect on aggregate cancellation is ambiguous. Despite being equivalent in a static setting, the design choice for the CPF matters in a dynamic context, such as the EU ETS.}
