The main idea is to use a reduced-form vector autoregression (VAR) that contains the fundamental drivers of the real price of oil,
\begin{equation}
	y_t = c + \sum_{i=1}^p \Phi_i y_{t-i} + \varepsilon_t,
\end{equation}
where $y_{t}\in\R^4$ is a vector of monthly data, $c\in\R^4$ is a vector of intercepts, and $\Phi_i\R^{4\times 4}$, for $i=1,\ldots, p$, are the coefficient matrices with $p$ indicating the number of lags. As always, $\varepsilon_t$ are the white-noise innovations.

The four variables are:
\begin{enumerate}[wide, itemsep=0cm, topsep=0cm]
	\item Percent change in global crude oil production;
	\item Estimate of the change in global crude oil inventories;
	\item Log of the real price of crude oil as measured by the US refiner acquisition cost of imported crude oil (RAC) deflated by the US consumer price index;
	\item Index of global real economic activity (REA).
\end{enumerate}
