Whether Bayesian methods help reduce the MSPE of our VAR dorecasts by using informative priors that shrink our highly-parameterised unconstrained models toward a parsimonious benchmark, and thus reduce estimation uncertainty.

\textbf{Important:} They want to develop a forecasting model that emphasises the final demand for petroleum products. \textbf{Not only supply}. They replace global oil production with a measure of petroleum consumption. The broadest available measure at the global level is monthly total world consumption of liquid fuels provided in the Short-Term Energy outlook database of the US Energy Information Administration (only available from 1990.1 onward; they extend it back to 1982.1 using the growth rate of OECD petroleum consumption).
