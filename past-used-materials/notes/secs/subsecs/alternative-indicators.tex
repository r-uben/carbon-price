\subsubsection{Global steel production factor}

\cite{ravazzolo2020world} suggests that steel is an important input for many industries including construction, transportation, and manufacturing, and that it is a relatively homogeneous commodity that is traded freely worldwide.

	World Steel Association: $\to$ aggregate measure of the level of steel production reported by member countries (consistent series only available since 1994).
\end{quote}

An increase in the number of steel-producing countiries leads to discrete jumps.

\cite{baumeister2020energy} propose an alternative way to construct a measure of global steel production that circumvents discontinuities and deals with the potential concern that world steel production is prone to idiosyncratic supply shocks in steel-producting countries.

\subsubsection{Summary}

All of the three alternative measures for global real economic activity do significantly better than the Killian index for forecasting either real RAC or Brent. However, none of these models beats the random walk at the intermediate horizons of 9 and 12 months ahead. Ovearall, forecasting oil prices with VAR models has become more difficult since 2010 and forecasting the real price of Brent poses additional challenges.
